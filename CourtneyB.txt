Hi Lambda people. My name is Courtney Buratto.
I'd say moody, considerate and intuitive describe me. I've always hated the three word describe me excercise, because i'm never sure if i want to include the less savory descriptors!
My favorite hobby is probably any type of bike riding. A few years ago I moved to the Rockies and took up downhill mountain biking. I fell in love with it immediately. Something about being on a bike gives you the ultimate control of your fate in that moment. It's one of the things I do that is wholistic, mind and body. A good ride will get your mind right.
