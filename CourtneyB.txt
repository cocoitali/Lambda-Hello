Hi Lambda people. My name is Courtney Buratto.
I'd say shallow, outgoing and inattentive describe me. I've always hated the three word describe me excercise, because i'm never sure if i want to include the less savory descriptors!
My favorite hobby is probably shopping for clothes and whatever makes me feel better about my lack of sustenance.

alternate reality only!!! :)
